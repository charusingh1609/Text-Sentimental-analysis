Emotion detection: the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc.
One of the applications of text mining is sentiment analysis or emotion detection. Most of the data is getting generated in textual format and in the past few years.This information  helps us to understand the trend and demand of the end user which results in Customer satisfaction


Data Preprocessing:
In the above-given problem statement I have performed various pre-processing steps on the dataset that mainly deal with removing stopwords, removing emojis. The text document is then converted into the lowercase for better generalization.

Subsequently, the punctuations were cleaned and removed thereby reducing the unnecessary noise from the dataset. After that, I have also removed the repeating characters from the words along with removing the URLs as they do not have any significant importance.
i have also use the concept of Tokenization, Stemming and Lemmatizer. I also used the concept of Dense, Embedding, LSTM, SpatialDropout1D.



Stop Word: Stop Words are words which do not contain important significance to be used in Search Queries. Usually these words are filtered out from search queries because they return vast amount of unnecessary information. ( the, for, this etc. )

Conclusion : In this project I was curious how well nltk,Dense,embedding,lstm,spatialDropout1D. I will try to implement some more ml algorithm to have a better accuracy score.
 aslo I will try to visulize it more deeply and clearly so that when we put hove our happiness or different emotion diagram i will show the
number of different emotions.



I have also make a another project on same datasets.

In given datasets we 13 different emotions. so i have converted the 13 diffrent emotions in 3 different emotions i.e positive, negative, or neutral.

postive will contain happiness ,surprise, love, fun, relif, enthusiasm.
negative will contain hate,sadness,worry,boredom and anger.

The main focus of this project will be calculating two scores: sentiment polarity and subjectivity using python. The range of polarity is from -1 to 1(negative to positive) and will tell us if the text contains positive or negative feedback. 
I will try to extend my analysis by creating some labels out of these scores.

Conclusion for project 2 - In this project I was curious how well nltk and the  sentiment polarity and subjectivity performs for emotion  Analysis and also i have used NaiveBayes Machine Learning algorithm performs for
 Sentiment Analysis.In my experience, it works rather well for negative comments. The problems arise when the tweets are ironic, sarcastic has reference or own difficult context.
